          Imali Yethu WhatsApp Service

        <div class="swiper-slide">Our aim to is to bridge the gap between information access and decision making</div>

        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p id="size"> Access to information is critical for enabling citizens to exercise their voice, to
            effectively monitor and hold government to account, and to enter into informed dialogue about decisions
            which
            affect their lives. </p>
        </div>
        <div class="swiper-slide"><img src="img/3.jpg"></div>

        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p id="size">It is seen as vital for empowering all citizens, including vulnerable and excluded
            people, to claim their broader rights and entitlements.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p id="size">But the potential contribution to good governance of
            access to information lies in both the willingness of government to be transparent, as well as the ability
            of
            citizens to demand and use information â€“ both of which may be constrained in low capacity settings.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="swiper-slide"><img src="img/2.jpg"></div>

        <div class="swiper-slide">
          <p id="size">A key
            question in this regard is: To what extent can access to information, and government transparency, advance
            the claims of poor and marginalised groups and make governments accountable?</p>
        </div>

        <div class="swiper-slide"><p id="size"> Imali Yethu aims at addressing some of these problems by enabling access to information to the marginalised population through exisitng technology </p> </div>

        <div class="swiper-slide">How it Works??</div>

        <div class="swiper-slide"><p id="works">A user will have to save the number provided
          <br> <b> 1 415 523 8886 </b> onto their phones
          Once save they will then need to navigate to whatsApp and look fo the number they just saved
        </p></div>

        <div class="swiper-slide"><p id="works">Once on whatsApp the user will then have to send the following message to the number <br>
          <b> join firebrick-tetra</b>
           see next slide for screen shot
        </p></div>
        <div class="swiper-slide"><img src="img/t1.png" alt=""></div>
        <div class="swiper-slide"><p id="works" >The service will then respond accrodingly the next step is to access the service by sending the message:
